        <p style="text-align: left; font-family: serif;">They usually don't hire people for short periods but I needed a summer job. I quickly showed them I was worth hiring. The sales team would come to me to make sure their sold cars got washed because they knew I would do a good in no time. My boss had a hard head with a nasty reputation but I left the company on excellent terms with him where he invited me to his wedding and gave me a going away gift. </p>
